Other notes.
I think it will be hard to orchestrate the proper sourcing/unsourcing of the files needed after the tutorial is run. Getting it to start automatically will be tricky. Update: It wasn't.

Big thanks to the Ponysay team for making this so much more fun!

Thanks to Sheri A. Sanders for working up the permissions tutorial.

Thanks to my dear hubby for being a patient beta-tester and not at all a computer person.
Thanks to my other testers! Bhavya NP! Natisha LD! Dan P!
