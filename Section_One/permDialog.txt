ponygo applejackscarecrow "Let's break the code down into separate parts:${n}${b}d  rwx  rwx  --- castle${n2}${b}The first letter, ${b}d${r}, means the castle is a ${b}directory${r}."
ponygo applejack "After the first letter, there are three sections.${n}${b}u:rwx  g:rwx  o:---${r}${n2}The sections represent different permissions for the three different categories of Unix users: the ${b}u${r}ser, the ${b}g${r}roup, and ${b}o${r}ther.${n2}The user owns that file or directory and is usually the one who made it. ${b}Groups${r} are defined sets users. ${b}Other${r} is everyone else."
ponygo applejack "In each of the three sections, there are three letters: ${b}rwx${r}.${n2}The letter ${b}r${r} stands for read, ${b}w${r} stands for write, and ${b}x${r} stands for execute. A (${b}dash${r} (${b}-${r}) can stand in as a lack of permission."
ponygo applejackscarecrow "Read permission allows you to read the ${b}contents${r} of that item.${n}Directories can contain files and other directories; files contain their contents.${n2}To see the name of a file inside a directory requires read permissions of the ${b}directory${r}. Reading what is inside a file requires read permissions of the ${b}file${r}."
ponygo fillyjack "Write permissions allow you to modify the ${b}contents${r} of the item.${n2}Changing the name of a file requires the ${b}directory${r} it's in to give you write permissions!${n2}It's like you need your parent's permission to change your name if you are underage.

ponygo applejack "To change the contents inside a file, though, you just need write permissions to the file. Take that, Mom n' Dad."
ponygo applejackscarecrow "Execute permissions on directories mean that you can enter the directory and access its contents.${n2}For files, think of ${b}x${r} permissions as making the file into a program, like an .exe file in Windows or a .dmg file on Mac. Most files don't need execute permissions."
ponygo fillyjacktravel "To put these concepts together, a file can be readable and writeable by the user who owns it, readable by members of the group the file is associated with, and no one else can touch it.${n2}So the file would have permissions ${b}rw- r-- ---.${r}"
