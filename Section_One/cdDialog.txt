ponygo pinkiebounce "Whenever you are logged into a Unix system using a shell, you have a ${b}location${r}, which is also called a ${b}directory${r} or a ${b}folder.${r}"
ponygo pinkie "You start out a new shell session from your home location. A home is where you sleep, so it makes sense that this is where you wake up!${n2}You can always find out where you are by typing in ${b}pwd${r} and hitting enter. Now you try it."; getInput 'pwd' "Not quite."; echo "Great! You are currently in:"; pwd
ponygo pinkiebounce "Let's practice some more!"; getInput 'pwd' "Not quite."; echo "Good job! You are currently in:";pwd
ponygo pinkiebounce "${b}Directories${r} in Unix are hierarchical, which means that a ${b}directory${r} can contain other directories in a nested way.${n2} ${b}Directories${r} inside the ${b}current directory${r} are called ${b}subdirectories.${r} The directory that contains your current location is called the ${b}parent directory.${r} ${n2}In the bash shell, the ${b}current directory${r} can be denoted by a shorthand of one dot (a period): \"${b}.${r}\". The parent is two dots: \"${b}..${r}\". There isn't a three dot shorthand though."
ponygo pinkie "To move to a different location, you will use the ${b}cd${r} command. cd stands for change directory.${n2}Think of it as opening a door, and going from one room into another.${n2}To go up a directory, you would use the ${b}cd${r} command followed by two dots.

ponygo pinkiebounce "Sometimes, you want to backtrack to where you just were. For this, you can use cd with the ${b}minus${r} sign, or ${b}dash.${r} Try it:"; getInput 'cd -' "Make sure you have just one dash."; echo "Now you backtracked to:"; cd -
ponygo pinkiesilly "You can only backtrack one step. If you keep typing in ${b}cd -${r}, you'll just bounce back and forth between two directories. Check it out:"; getInput 'cd -' "Make sure you have just one dash."; echo "And now you are back to:"; cd -
ponygo pinkie "Have you seen a squiggly line, like ${b}~${r}? This character is called a ${b}tilde${r}, and it stands for your home directory in Unix. You can use it with the cd command to, like:${n}cd ~${n}There is an even easier way, though. The ${b}cd${r} command (by itself and with nothing after it) also takes you back home. No matter how lost you are, or how hard you party, you can always get home with just cd."; getInput 'cd' "Don't give up!"; echo "Now you are back home!"; cd; pwd
