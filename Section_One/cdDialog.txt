ponygo pinkie "Hi! I'll be your instructor for the lesson on getting around in Unix."
ponygo pinkiebounce "Whenever you are logged into a Unix system using a shell, you have a location, which is also called a directory or a folder."
ponyNoClear pinkie "You start out a new shell session from your home location. A home is where you sleep, so it makes sense that this is where you wake up!${n2}You can always find out where you are by typing in pwd and hitting enter. Now you try it."; getInput 'pwd' "Not quite."; echo "Great! You are currently in:"; pwd
ponygo pinkiebounce "Directories in Unix are hierarchical, which means that a directory can contain other directories in a nested way.${n2}Directories inside the current directory are called subdirectories. The directory that contains your current location is called the parent directory.${n2}In the bash shell, the current directory can be denoted by a shorthand of one dot (a period): \".\". The parent is two dots: \"..\". There isn't a three dot shorthand though."
ponygo pinkie "To move to a different location, you will use the cd command. cd stands for change directory.${n2}Think of it as opening a door, and going from one room into another.${n2}To go up a directory, you would use the cd command followed by two dots. You should try it!"; getInput 'cd ..' "Make sure you have a space between cd and the two dots."; cd ..; echo; sleep 0.2; echo -n .; sleep 0.2; echo -n .; sleep 0.2; echo  .;  echo "No errors were printed, so it worked! You are currently in:";  pwd
ponygo  pinkiebounce "Sometimes, you want to backtrack to where you just were. For this, you can use cd with the minus sign, or dash. Try it:"; getInput 'cd -' "Make sure you have just one dash."; echo "Now you backtracked to:";  cd -
ponygo  pinkiesilly "You can only backtrack one step. If you keep typing in cd -, you'll just bounce back and forth between two directories. Check it out:"; getInput 'cd -' "Make sure you have just one dash."; echo "And now you are back to:"; cd -
ponygo pinkie "Have you seen a squiggly line, like ~? This character is called a tilde, and it stands for your home directory in Unix. You can use it with the cd command to, like:${n}cd ~${n}There is an even easier way, though. The cd command (by itself and with nothing after it) also takes you back home. No matter how lost you are, or how hard you party, you can always get home with just cd."; getInput 'cd' "Don't give up!"; echo "Now you are back home!"; cd; pwd
ponygo pinkiecannon "Great job! You are done with this section. Good luck, $PONYUSER!"
