ponygo aloe "Hello $PONYUSER! welcome to the first lesson about moving files and the mv command."
ponygo aloe "When we want to move files or directories from one location to another, we use the ${b}mv${r} command, which stands for move. It essentially allows us to cut and paste a file or directory into another location."
ponygo aloe "The move command works by stating a source file - which is either the file or directory you want to move, and then stating the target directory - which is where you want to place the file or directory.\n\n ${b}mv source_file(s) target_directory${r}"
ponygo aloe "For example, I currently have a file named ${b}pony${r} in the directory ${b}/home/ponylinux/${r} and I want to move it to a another directory called ${b}/home/ponies${r}. If you are in the current directory where the pony file is located, you would type the following command:\n\n ${b}mv pony /home/ponies${r}"
ponygo aloe "If you are not in the same directory as the pony file then you will need to state the absolute path for the pony file. Then command you would type to move the pony file to the new location would then be the following:\n\n ${b}mv /home/ponylinux/pony /home/ponies${r}"
ponygo aloe "Let's say that instead of moving one file you want to move multiple files. The ${b}mv${r} command makes this very easy. You simply list all the files you want to move and then state the target directory."
ponygo aloe "For example, you have three files name file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt in the directory ${b}/home/ponylinux/${r} and you want to move the three files to the directory ${b}/home/ponies${r}. The command you would input would be the following:\n\n ${b}mv file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /home/ponies${r}"
ponygo aloe "${b}mv file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt /home/ponies${r}"$[n2}You simply list all of the files you want to move and then put the ${b}targe_directory${r} at the end."
ponygo aloe "The mv command also allows you to rename a file. For example, if you have a file names file1.txt in the directory ${b}/home/ponies${r}."
ponygo aloe "To rename the file to pony_1.txt, you will input the following command (while currently in the same directory as file1.txt):\n\n ${b}mv file1.txt pony_1.txt${r}"
ponygo aloe "The move command also allows you to rename the file as you move it to it's new location. For example, you have the newly named pony_1.txt file in the directory ${b}/home/ponies${r} and you want to move it to ${b}/home/ponylinux/${r} with a new name of first_pony.txt."
ponygo aloe "To do this, you will type the following command (while in pony_1.txt's current directory):\n\n ${b}mv pony_1.txt /home/ponylinux/first_pony.txt${r} \n ${b}move source_file target_directory/target_file${r}"
ponygo aloe "What you have done here is move the source_file pony_1.txt to the target directory ${b}/home/ponylinux${r} with new  name of first_pony.txt."
ponygo aloe "Using the ${b}mv command${r} is extremely useful when you want to move files, directories and to rename files and directories."
