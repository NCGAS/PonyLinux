ponygo rainbowfirm "The ${b}/bin${r} directory contains many commands that you can run, like bash itself. Bin stands for binary, which is the format that many commands are in - binary machine code which is ready to talk to the computer. Binary files are hard for humans to read!"
ponygo rainbow "Another good directory to know is ${b}/usr/local${r}, which has code in it customized to this computer. ${n2}The ${b}/lib${r} and ${b}/lib64${r} directories contain libraries, which are software codes that are intended to be put inside other code and work in a modular way."
ponygo rainbowfly "The ${b}/tmp${r} directory is a place you can put temporary files that are generated while a command runs.${n2}${b}/etc, /var, /proc,${r} and ${b}/sbin${r} are usually locked down to administrators - they contain operating system files."
ponygo rainbow "Your home directory might be in ${b}/home/username${r}. For me it would be ${b}/home/rdash${r}, for example.${n2}It is also possible that your home directory is somewhere custom to that machine, for example in ${b}/N/u/rdash${r} or ${b}/users/rdash${r}. Where home directories are located depends on how the computer is set up."
ponygo rainbowfirm "I'll let you in on a secret directory. It's called ${b}/dev/shm${r}, and only the most clever of us venture there. This looks like any other place on the system, but it is actually on the computer's memory or RAM and not on a hard drive. It's wicked fast to put files there."
ponygo rainbowfly "On our systems, there are other places to put files, especially big genomics files which can be hundreds of gigabytes in size."
ponygo rainbowsalute "On IU systems such as Carbonate and Big Red 200, the best place to put big files is on ${b}Slate${r} while you are actively using the files. When you are done, move them to long term storage."
ponygo rainbow "Many HPC systems you might work on will have this setup - a 'scratch' or 'short term' space and a slow, long term storage space."
ponygo rainbowfly "Hopefully that tells you a bit about the anatomy of an HPC machine!"
