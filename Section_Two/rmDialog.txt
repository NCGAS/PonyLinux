ponygo joe "Joining the tour of the Pony Hospital? Great! This is where we remove problem files from our ponies!"
ponygo snowheart "Hello, $PONYUSER! The staff will walk you through how we use our greatest tool - ${b}rm${r}.  This is a powerful tool, but also one that can cause trouble if not used carefully! There won't be much practice here, since you are in training - but there will be plenty of practice if you have to go back to the dungeon."
ponygo redheart "Files and folder can be easily deleted using the ${b}rm${r} command in Unix. "
ponygo snowheart "${b}rm${r} stands for ${b}remove${r}. (Just think of the Unix developers as being rly gd @ txting!)"
ponygo rhyme "To remove a file in Unix, you simply specify what file(s) you want to have removed. "
ponygo redheart "By default, the ${b}rm${r} command only removes files and ${b}NOT${r} directories."
ponygo drcabelleron "In order to remove a directory you must include the flag ${b}-r${r} or ${b}-R${r} which means that it will ${b}recursively${r} delete the directory itself, its sub-directories and all of the files that they contain (goodbye directory!)."
ponygo joe "An alternative for removing directories is to use the ${b}rmdir${r} command."
ponygo joe "The ${b}rmdir command${r} will remove each directory you have listed. If any of your listed directories are ${b}NOT${r} empty, then rmdir will not remove it!"
ponygo horsemd "One important thing to understand is once you remove a file or a directory, it is permanently deleted without a chance of being recovered!"
ponygo drcabelleron "Unfortunately, in Unix you are not given the option of having a trash bin where your accidental deleted files and directories will go for safe trash keeping. Therefore it is very important for you to be sure that you want to remove any file or directory."
ponygo redheart "For those of you that don't want to take the risk of deleting very important files or directories, have no fear because Unix has you covered! "
ponygo redheart "To be sure you are deleting the correct files or directories you can insert the flag ${b}-i${r} which will ask you if you are sure you want to delete each file/directory you are about to remove."
ponygo drcabelleron "If you're not that fearful and want to live slightly on the wild side, there is a safety net you can use the flag ${b}-I${r}, which will only prompt you if you are removing more than three files/directories!"
ponygo horsemd "I'm sure you have noticed by now that there are a lot of basic Unix commands that you can use that would possibly deeply sadden you, if used incorrectly!  The ${b}rm${r} command is one of these - it can literally destroy your day's work if used incorrectly!"
ponygo joe "You are about to learn an ${b}rm${r} command that I strongly advise you to never use unless you are a professional!"
ponygo rhyme "Warning, the most dangerous rm command that you can use is ${b}rm -r${r}."
ponygo snowheart "This command will remove all files and all directories in your current path. If you are in your home directory, you could potentially wipe your entire computer and there is nothing you can do to get your files and directories back!"
ponygo redheart "If you lived on the wild side and took it a step further by adding the additional flag ${b}-f${r} that we learned about in the copy and paste section then I don't know what to say about you! Using ${b}rm -rf${r} will remove all files and directories by force which will make sure everything is gone. Once again, do not use unless you are extremely careful or a professional!"
ponygo hayfever "Be very careful when using the ${b}rm${r} commands. But most importantly, if you are going to use ${b}rm -r *${r} command', double and triple check yourself before you press the enter button!"
