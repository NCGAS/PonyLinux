ponygo aloe "Files and folder can be easily deleted using the ${b}rm command${r} in Unix. "
ponygo aloe "${b}rm${r} stands for ${b}remove${r}. (Just think of the Unix developers as being rly gd @ txting!)"
ponygo aloe "To remove a file in Unix, you simply specify what file(s) you want to have removed. "
ponygo aloe "By default, the ${b}rm${r} command only removes files and ${b}NOT${r} directories."
ponygo aloe "In order to remove a directory you must include the flag ${b}-r${r} or ${b}-R${r} which means that it will ${b}recursively${r} delete the directory itself, its sub-directories and all of the files that they contain (goodbye directory!)."
ponygo aloe "An alternative for removing directories is to use the ${b}rmdir command.${r}"
ponygo aloe "The ${b}rmdir command${r} will remove each directory you have listed. If any of your listed directories are ${b}NOT${r} empty, then rmdir will not remove it!"
ponygo aloe "One important thing to understand is once you remove a file or a directory, it is permanently deleted without a chance of being recovered!"
ponygo aloe "Unfortunately, in Unix you are not given the option of having a trash bin where your accidental deleted files and directories will go for safe trash keeping. Therefore it is very important for you to be sure that you want to remove any file or directory."
ponygo aloe "For those of you that don't want to take the risk of deleting very important files or directories, have no fear because Unix has you covered! "
ponygo aloe "To be sure you are deleting the correct files or directories you can insert the flag ${b}-i${r} which will ask you if you are sure you want to delete each file/directory you are about to remove."
ponygo aloe "If you're not that fearful and want to live slightly on the wild side, there is a safety net you can use the flag ${b}-I${r}, which will only prompt you if you are removing more than three files/directories!"
ponygo aloe "I'm sure you have noticed by now that there are a lot of basic Unix commands that you can use that would possibly deeply sadden you, if used incorrectly!"
ponygo aloe "The ${b}rm${r} command is not one of these because it would beyond deeply sadden and destroy your day if used incorrectly, literally!"
ponygo aloe "You are about to learn an ${b}rm${r} command that I strongly advise you to never use unless you are a professional!"
ponygo aloe "Warning, the most dangerous rm command that you can use is ${b}rm -r${r}."
ponygo aloe "This command will remove all files and all directories in your current path. If you are in your home directory, you could potentially wipe your entire computer and there is nothing you can do to get your files and directories back!"
ponygo aloe "If you lived on the wild side and took it a step further by adding the additional flag -f that we learned about in the copy and paste section then I don't know what to say about you! Using rm -rf will remove all files and directories by force which will make sure everything is gone. Once again, do not use unless you are extremely careful or a professional!"
ponygo aloe "Be very careful when using the rm commands. But most importantly, if you are going to use ${b}rm -r *${r} command', double and triple check yourself before you press the enter button!"
