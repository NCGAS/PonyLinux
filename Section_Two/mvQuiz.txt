Which of the following actions can you accomplish with with mv?	3	Cut and paste a file into a new location but with a different file name	You can do this with mv, however, all the other answers are also correct.

Which of the following does not belong - ie, is NOT equivalent to the others?	1	mv recipes/*.txt ../	This is the same as the others except for mv recipes/*.txt ./	mv recipes/*.txt ./	This is the odd one out because it moves the recipes into the current directory, not the directory above me.	mv recipes/pie.txt recipes/cake.txt recipes/cookies.txt ../	This is the same as the first one. The different one is mv recipes/*.txt ./
Which of the following will give an error?	2	mv recipes/*.txt ./	This is perfectly valid, I am moving all the text files from my recipes folder into my current folder.	mv * ../	This will work, and the contents of the current directory will be bumped up into the parent directory. Only hidden files are immune.	mv recipes/pie.txt recipes/cake.txt recipes/cookies.txt	This will fail because there is no destination! The last argument must be a folder in order to move multiple files.
