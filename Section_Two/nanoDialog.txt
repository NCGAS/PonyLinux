ponygo raritycomplaining "In Section One, we talked about opening files with the ${b}less${r} command. Now let's revisit ways to read and write files.";cp -n ${UNIXTUT}/Section_Two/starbucks.txt . 2>/dev/null; cp -n ${UNIXTUT}/Section_Two/coffee.txt . 2>/dev/null
ponygo fillyrarity "To see inside a file, you can do one of two things - print the file to the screen, or use a program that lets you navigate inside a file. Let's start with printing file contents to the screen."
ponygo rarity "It's helpful to start looking at a file by getting a sneak preview. You can take a look at the first few lines of the file using the ${b}head${r} command. You can look at the last few lines of a file using the ${b}tail${r} command."
ponygo fillyrarity "By default, ${b}head${r} prints the first 10 or so lines of a file. You can specify how many lines to display with ${b}-n${r} like this:${n2}${b}head -n 5 starbucks.txt${r}${n2}Sometime you just need the first line, for example, or maybe the first hundred. Try it:"; getInput 'head -n 5 starbucks.txt' 'Close! Try again!'; head -n 5 starbucks.txt
ponygo rarityponder "${b}Tail${r} is the same way; you can specify how many lines to grab from the end of the file. One other great use for ${b}tail${r} is to have it to watch a file that is changing. The ${b}-f${r} flag tells ${b}tail${r} to keep showing an update of the last lines of the file."
ponygo rarityelite "Lots of files are updated by appending text to the end, so ${b}tail -f${r} can watch it grow in real time. This is useful if you need to see outputs right away, or are watching a log file for errors."
ponygo raritycomplaining "It can look like the computer is hanging after you run ${n}${b}tail -f starbucks.txt${r}${n}because it is sitting there waiting for changes. When you are ready to stop watching the file, you can hit ${b}ctrl+c${r}."
ponygo rarityfly "${b}Head${r} and ${b}tail${r} give you previews, but for small files you can get away with printing the whole file. It's useful to know how many lines are in a file first - to do this, you would use the word count command, ${b}wc${r}. Specify lines with the ${b}-l${r} flag, like:${n2}${b}wc -l starbucks.txt${r}"; getInput 'wc -l starbucks.txt' "Keep trying, don't give up!"; wc -l starbucks.txt 
ponygo fillyrarity "When you do ${b}wc -l starbucks.txt${r} It should return:${n}      37 starbucks.txt${n2}That's 37 lines. If the file doesn't have too many lines (maybe a hundred or so), you can print the whole thing to the screen using the ${b}cat${r} command."
ponygo opal "Meow? Not that kind of cat. The ${b}cat${r} command is short for concatenate. It can be used to put multiple files together, but is also fine for viewing a small file. To read a file called coffee.txt, you would do:${n}${b}cat coffee.txt${r}."; getInput 'cat coffee.txt' 'Almost, give it another go'; cat coffee.txt
ponygo rarity "For a larger file, you might not want all of that output on your window. The ${b}less${r} program will create a new sub-window for you to look over your file. We talked about ${b}less${r} at the end of Section One, but it's good to look at again - it's one of the commands I use the most."
ponygo rarity "${b}Less${r} shows you the contents of the file, and it only loads a small chunk at a time. This means you can open files that are hundreds of gigabytes without crashing your machine."
ponygo raritycomplaining "Try not to hit the \"v\" key while in ${b}less${r}. You can accidentally fall into ${b}vi/vim${r} mode.${n2}If you do this, you'll see INSERT mode or some weird stuff on the bottom. Don't panic, just type ${b}escape+:${r}, then type in ${b}q!${r} and you will be back in normal mode."    
ponygo raritycomplaining "${b}Less${r} ususally wraps long lines of text, which can make it a little hard to read certain files. You may notice a backslash (${b}\\${r}) on the right hand side of the screen in Unix - this means that the text continues to the next line.${n2}If you type a ${b}\ ${r}on the command line and hit enter, you will notice that bash is waiting for you to finish your thoughts before it does anything."
ponygo rarityfly "In ${b}less${r}, you can tell lines not to wrap. You would open it like this:${n2}${b}less -S starbucks.txt${r}."; bash ${UNIXTUT}/minibash.sh $'Open the starbucks.txt file with less. Use q to exit less.\nType quit when you are done $ '
ponygo rarityponder "The downside to ${b}less${r} is that you can only read the file, not change it in any way."
ponygo rarity "To open a file so that you can change its contents, you will need an editor such as ${b}nano/pico, vim,${r} or ${b}emacs${r}.${n2}Nano and pico are similar, though you are more likely to find nano. Vim is similar to vi and you'll probably run into it more often."
ponygo rarity "${b}Vim${r} and ${b}emacs${r} are not the most beginner friendly, so I'll be teaching you about ${b}nano${r} for now."
ponygo fillyrarity "You open ${b}nano${r} like so:${n2}${b}nano starbucks.txt${r}"
ponygo rarityelite "Once inside, you will see a screen kinda like ${b}less${r}, but with a handy bar at the bottom with commands you can perform. For example, to quit:${n}${b}^X Exit${r}${n}means to hold ctrl and the x key at the same time. Try it!${n2}${b}nano starbucks.txt${r}"; bash ${UNIXTUT}/minibash.sh  $'Open the starbucks.txt file with nano. Look around and then exit.\nType quit when you are done $ '
ponygo raritygala "The full help menu for ${b}nano${r} can be brought up using ${b}ctrl+G${r}. ${b}Nano${r} is the easiest editor to learn for Unix beginners, but it is a good idea to play around for a while until you get the hang of things."
ponygo rarityponder "Here are a few quick pointers for nano:${nt}To search, ${b}ctrl+w${r} will prompt you for text to find.${nt}Use ${b}ctrl+o${r} to save your file. It behaves like a \"save as\" and will always ask you for a name to save it.${nt}${b}ctrl+x${r} lets you exit out of ${b}nano${r}."
ponygo fillyrarity "One more pro tip! Sending files between Mac, Windows, and Linux computers can make them look messed up. One great thing about nano is if you open a file that has a different ${b}encoding${r}, like for Mac Or Windows, nano will fix it. You have to make a change to the file and save it from nano! Problem solved!"
ponygo rarity "That's it for opening files!"
