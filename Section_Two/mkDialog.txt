ponygo carrot "We've covered how to move, rename, open, follow, and remove files and directories - but now it's time to start making new things."
ponygo grace "Welcome to the Pony Studio and Makerspace! Quests require you to be creative! There are several ponies in the space, and they'll help you learn how to make things!"
ponygo pinkie "Like all artists and makers, let's start with what we know: ${b}nano${r}.  Remember ${b}nano${r} was the easiest way to edit files... but it can also be used to create new ones!"
ponygo misspommel "Thankfully, creating and editing a very similar.  If you use ${b}nano${r} on a file that exists, it will open the file and edit it.  However, if the filename does not exist, it will create a file for you with that new name!"
ponygo pinkieumbrellahat "You do have to save the file... how did we do that in nano, again?  Oh! Right! ${b}ctrl+o${r} (for write Out).  If you have write permissions to the folder, your new file will become a permanent part of your directory (until you move or remove it!)."
ponygo pinkieumbrellahatfear "Do know, you can create new files with ${b}nano${r} in directories where you do not have write permissions - but you will not be able to save them - bummer."
ponygo shoeshine "See my masterpiece over here?  I call it Marshmellows in Snow... though you might just call it a blank file.  If you want to create a blank file without having to open it with ${b}nano${r}, you can also use the ${b}touch${r} command."
ponygo pokey "Much like ${b}nano${r}, you just have to specify the name of the file you wish to create.  Give it a whirl!"; getInput 'touch sugar_and_salt_mosaic' "Try again! Drafts are just practice!"; echo "Great job!"
ponygo shoeshine "Beautiful!! One more and we've got a triptic!"
ponygo jetstream "touch will also update the date on a file (which you can see with ${b}ls -l${r})."
ponygo stellareclipse "Sometimes, we need to make containers for all of our beautiful art.  Let's make a drying rack directory to store all of our new art!"
ponygo pinkiebounce "Remember ${b}rmdir${r} as a way to.. rm dirs?  To make dirs, we ${b}mkdir name_of_dir${r} (that's way far easier than using all of these powertools with our hooves!).  How about you give it a whirl?"; getInput 'mkdir drying_rack' "Hm. That doesn't look quite stable - give it another try..."; echo "What a beautiful creation!"
ponygo stellareclipse "Now I'll ${b}mv${r} our painting files to that directory! You're so quick at this (must be those thumbs) - let's make a couple things at once!  Who doesn't like multitasking?"
ponygo carrot "You can make multiple folders at once, just by listing them."; getInput 'mkdir easle 3Dprinter plaster' "Try try again!"; echo "Yes!"
ponygo pinkiewhoops "Ooof.  I guess I should have been more careful with my requests.  I'm going to stay back and clean up this mess, but you should get back to your mission! May your create more wonderful things in your quests!  Good luck $PONYUSER!" ~/.unixTut/config
