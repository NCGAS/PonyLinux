Upon opening the door to the hall you are immediately overwhelmed by a stream of bats flying in your face. The noise and wings buffet you, completely drowning out all rational thought as you wave your arms frantically trying to clear the space around your head. Claws and wings leave little papercuts on you as the swarm passes, dealing you 5 damage. As suddenly as they flew out, the last of the bats passes you and once again you are left in silence to take in the rather plain looking passageway before you. To either side, doors marked Door_ followed by three random seeming letters and numbers.
