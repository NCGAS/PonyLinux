You open the door and the hallway before you looks like it belongs in a tavern. Wooden beams and panelling make up the walls and ceiling, and there are unadorned wool rugs under your feet. Wrought iron candle holders jut from the walls, with long ivory candles that keep the hall well-lit. There are several chandeliers hanging from iron chains from the beams of the ceiling, also lit with candles. At the end of the hall, iron-braced wooden doors stand before you, marked with black paint: Door_ followed by three random seeming letters and numbers.
