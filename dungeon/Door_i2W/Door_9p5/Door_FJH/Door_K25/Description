The hallway before you has strange markings on the floor. You walk carefully, trying to figure out what they mean, when one of the floor tiles gives way when you step on it. A dart flies out of a hole in the wall you didn't see before, striking you in the arm for 10 damage. You yipe in surprise, briefly glad no one is around to witness your un-heroic squeak. More cautious now, you find three more tiles that look suspicious and are able to avoid tripping them. You get to the other side where there are innocent-looking doors marked Door_ followed by three random seeming letters and numbers.
