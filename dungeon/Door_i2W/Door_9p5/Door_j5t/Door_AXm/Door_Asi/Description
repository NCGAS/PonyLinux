Nothing seems too particularly notable about this dark hallway until you let your hand graze against the wall. Everything, it seems, is lined with soot. The dark powder sticks instantly to you and soon starts to spread to your clothes as well. Whatever color you had on your items is soon obscured by the clinging soot. Ahead you see door after door, marked Door_ followed by three random seeming letters and numbers.
