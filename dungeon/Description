You look around as the large, ponderous dungeon doors close behind you. There's an unsettling finality to the way they shut, but your job is to perform a rescue. As you make your way into the hall, you kick something metal across the floor. It looks like some kind of key. You pocket it away for safe keeping and look around. Whoever built this dungeon had an odd sense of naming rooms. Each door is labeled Door_ followed by three random seeming letters and numbers.
