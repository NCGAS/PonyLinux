# unixTut
Fun game based heavily on Ponysay to teach bash


## To install on a new system: ##
Step one is to install Ponysay, and make sure that python3 is somewhere in your path.

I had to run:
  * sudo apt-get update
  * sudo apt-get install texinfo
  * git clone https://github.com/erkin/ponysay.git
  * sudo python3 setup.py --freedom=partial install

Then I was ready to launch my own script:
  * cd unixTut
  * bash IntroToUnix.sh
