# unixTut
Welcome to PonyLinux! An I.T training game that teaches you about the terminal in Linux, using bash commands.
Walk through a series of tutorial sections that will teach you different bash commands, what they do, and how to use them in the Dungeon section!
There will be mini sessions to ensure you get more practice and engagement, so that you get the most of out of PonyLinux.
Your job will be to find the princess in the final dungeon, so go on brave one, and be a hero while learning about Linux!
