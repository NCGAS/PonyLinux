## Welcome to PonyLinux!
<img align="right" width="200" src="/Images/ponyicon.png" alt="Logo for PonyLinux, which is a blue pony with a streak through the mane">
PonyLinux is a short, very basic tutorial on using the **command line** in Unix operating systems such as Ubuntu and CentOS Linux.

Walk through a series of tutorial sections that will teach you different **commands**, what they do, and how to use them to defeat a Dungeon! There will be mini sessions to ensure you get more practice and engagement, so that you get the most of out of PonyLinux.
Your job will be to find the Princess in the final dungeon, so go on brave one, and be a hero while learning about Linux!

## SECTION ONE ##

Section one introduces *commands* that can be run using text. 
```
cd
ls
pwd
find
chmod
less
```
Section One wraps up with a challenge. Use the commands you learned during tutorials to defeat a dungeon set up using files and folders right in the Linux environment. Your goal is to find the princess in the dungeon with the knowledge you gained in the tutorial.

## SECTION TWO - Coming Soon ##
The goals of section two will be to start getting into more bash commands that will introduce you to doing new things in the terminal.
There will be more computer technical terms, that will gradually increase your knowledge of technical talk.

## Getting Started ##
The easiest way to get started with PonyLinux is to use Jetstream, located at https://jetstream-cloud.org/. You may find this NCGAS blog on Jetstream helpful - https://ncgas.org/Blog_Posts/Getting%20Started%20on%20Jetstream.php

You will need to do the following:
1. Go to the Jetstream link above. Click on "Request Trial Account".
  1. Screenshot
1. Get an XSEDE account following instructions in the link in step 1. Enroll in Jetstream Trial Access.
1. Login to Jetstream: https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/login.
1. Go ahead and Launch a New Instance!
1. Search for PonyLinux in the image search. You can launch this with the default settings, usually :smile:
1. When your instance is available, click on the Web Desktop to the right to bring up a desktop on your new cloud computer.
1. You should see a pony icon on the desktop. Double click on it to get started!
## FAQ ##
* **Q**: Is PonyLinux a Linux distribution (distro)?
* **A**: Nope. It's just some shell scripts. But if you crave a Pony-themed operating system, maybe check out PonyOS at https://ponyos.org/.

* **Q**: What do ponies and Linux have to do with bioinformatics?
* **A**: NCGAS teaches many workshops on bioinformatic techniques, doing certain experiments, and working with certain kinds of data. So much software that we use is written for Linux primarily, that we require workshop attendees to come in with some familiarity with command line. PonyLinux is meant to be a primer we can give our attendees to get them ready for our classes.

* **Q**: Why are there ponies? Why not something else?
* **A**: I found ponysay while surfing the web, and was so excited about putting images into bash that I thought it would make it easier to learn bash. If there are other images out on the web, fork my project and make it happen.

* **Q**: You use terminal, bash, shell, command line, Unix, and Linux all interchangeably. What gives?
* **A**: It's true, these concepts are all related. How bout this: Many software projects I deal with only run on Linux operating systems, which are a subset of UNIX standards from way back when. I primarily interact with this software through a command line interface, which is just text, as opposed to a graphical interface, which has pictures. Bash is a shell program, which means it understands what commands you type into the terminal. The terminal emulates a direct connection to the operating system, similar to a CMD or DOS window. There are other shell programs that speak slightly different languages from bash.

## National Center for Genome Analysis Support and HPC ##
The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) gives a 'first impression' introduction to high performance computing (HPC) at Indiana University and IUPUI roughly in the beginning of each semester. We provide this workshop to help new users learn about what HPC resources are available to them, talk about other course offerings, and NCGAS services.
