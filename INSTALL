To install, a few different options exist for you:

Add the current directory to your path. Don't move the contents of the Sections around, since the program will look for files in there relative to this directory.

Ponysay relies on Python3 to work. Make sure it's in your path as well.

I added ponysay as a git submodule. If you used git clone to get the unixTut files, you will need to do:
git submodule init
git submodule update
This should pull in the ponysay files and you can refer to the instructions in that folder.

Try this first:
---------------------
cd ponysay
python3 setup.py --freedom=partial install --private
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
ponysay "testing"


Troubleshooting
--------------------
I've run into errors on some systems (silo at indiana, for example) where ponysay fails at the Compiling step:

::Compiling...

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gzip': 'gzip'

The python3 I was using was in /usr/local, so I switched to the python/3.7 module and ran it with these parameters:
python3 setup.py --freedom=partial install --private  --prefix=$(pwd) --without-info

The $(pwd) command in the prefix just substitutes in the current directory, so this builds in-place. You could change it to the full path of unixTut, or leave it alone if you are ok with it going into ~/.local. In any case, you will need to add the bin directory to your PATH variable.
